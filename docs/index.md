## 1 - The problems:

### 2.1 Poor context

    - Schema documentation
        * field names not easily usable,
        * non-English language,
        * lack of comments,
        * lack of 'jargon' -&gt; need for hints,
        * lack of explicitly defined Foreign Keys
    - lack of &quot;values&quot; contained in the fields
    - schema dimensions (mess-up on small models)


Structured with a backend (Django application) and a frontend
