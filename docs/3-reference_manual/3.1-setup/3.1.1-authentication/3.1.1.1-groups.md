# Group Management

In Django's authentication system, the framework used by Thoth's backend component, a group is a way to categorize users and assign them permissions collectively. Instead of assigning permissions to each individual user, it's possible to assign them to a group, and all users in that group will inherit those permissions.

In Thoth, the group concept has been extended to offer more granular control over the user experience. This has been achieved through a "Group Profile" (`GroupProfile`) that is associated with each standard Django group.

## 1 - Group Profile

When creating or modifying a group in Thoth's administration interface, in addition to the standard name and permissions, it's possible to configure a series of additional settings that define how users of that group will interact with the system.

These settings are grouped in the "Group Profile Settings" section.

### 1.1 - Display Settings

The following options control which information is shown to group users during their interactions with Thoth's frontend component, which generates and executes SQL from a text request.

- **Show SQL**: If enabled, users will be able to see the SQL queries generated by the AI. This is useful for technical users who want to verify the SQL instructions that were executed to obtain the data shown in the output table.
- **Show keywords**: If enabled, keywords extracted from the user's request will be shown. This information helps understand what was the AI's starting point for performing similarity searches, extracting hints, and preselecting tables and columns to propose to the AI model responsible for generating the SQL.
- **Show hints**: If enabled, users will see the "hints" that the system found relevant to the request. Hints are pre-loaded information that guides the AI in SQL generation when the request contains terms and "jargon" not directly traceable to tables and columns, even using descriptions.
- **Show process info**: If enabled, detailed information about the request processing will be shown, such as the various steps performed by the AI.
- **Show SQL generation**: If enabled, the user will be able to see the SQL query generation process, including intermediate steps and decisions made by the AI.
- **Explain generated query**: If enabled, the AI will provide a natural language explanation of the generated SQL query. This is particularly useful for non-technical users to understand the purpose of the query.

### 1.2 - Results Management

This setting defines how the system should behave in a specific situation.

- **Treat empty result set as an error**: If enabled, a query result that produces no rows (an "empty set") will be treated as an error. This can be useful in scenarios where a result is always expected and an empty set indicates a problem or a poorly posed question. If disabled, an empty result set is considered a valid response.
