# User Management

User management in Thoth is based on Django's standard authentication system, which provides a solid framework for managing users, groups, and permissions. This section describes how users are managed within Thoth and what information is associated with each user.

## 1 - The User Concept

In Django's authentication system, a "User" represents an individual who can access and interact with the application. Each user has their own credentials (username and password) and a set of permissions that define what actions they can perform within the system.

Thoth uses Django's standard `User` model without direct extensions. This means that the basic information managed for each user is the default set by Django.

## 2 - Information Managed in the User Form

When creating or modifying a user from Thoth's administration interface, the following sections of information are managed:

### 2.1 - Personal Data
- **Username**: The unique name used for login.
- **Password**: The authentication password. For security reasons, the password is never shown in clear text.
- **First name**: The user's first name.
- **Last name**: The user's last name.
- **Email address**: The user's email address.

### 2.2 - Status and Permissions
- **Active**: A flag indicating whether the user is active. If deactivated, the user cannot log in.
- **Staff status**: A flag indicating whether the user can access the administration interface.
- **Superuser status**: A flag that, when active, grants the user all system permissions, bypassing any specific checks.

### 2.3 - Groups and Individual Permissions
- **Groups**: In this section, you can assign the user to one or more groups. Permissions in Thoth are primarily managed at the group level.
- **User permissions**: Specific permissions can be assigned directly to a user, although the recommended practice is to manage permissions through groups.

## 3 - The Role of Groups and Group Profiles

The true customization of user management in Thoth occurs at the **Group** level. While the `User` model is standard, each `Group` in Thoth is associated with a **Group Profile** (`GroupProfile`) that defines in detail the functionalities and views that users in that group will have access to.

When a user is assigned to a group, they inherit all the settings defined in the profile of that group. This allows for centralized and consistent configuration of the user experience for entire categories of users.

For details on how to configure groups and their profiles, refer to the specific documentation:
