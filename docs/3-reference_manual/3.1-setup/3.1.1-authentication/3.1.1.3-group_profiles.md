# Group Profiles

## 1 - What is a Group Profile?

In Thoth, a **Group Profile** is an extension of the standard `Group` model provided by Django. Whenever a new user group is created, the system automatically associates a profile with that group.

The primary purpose of a `GroupProfile` is to provide granular control over features and information displayed to users belonging to a specific group. Through profile configuration, an administrator can customize the user experience, deciding which interface elements and internal process details should be visible.

## 2 - Group Profile Fields

The administration form for a `GroupProfile` exposes a set of boolean options (Yes/No) that allow detailed permission and visibility configuration for the associated user group.

### 2.1 - Show SQL

*   **Field Name**: `show_sql`
*   **Purpose**: If enabled, users in this group will be able to view the final SQL query generated by the system in response to their requests. It's useful for experienced users or debugging purposes.

### 2.2 - Show keywords

*   **Field Name**: `show_keywords`
*   **Purpose**: Controls the visibility of the section displaying the keywords extracted from the user's request. This option is generally helpful in understanding how the system interprets natural language.

### 2.3 - Show hints

*   **Field Name**: `show_hints`
*   **Purpose**: If enabled, users will see "hints" provided by the system to help them formulate their questions better or explore data.

### 2.4 - Show process info

*   **Field Name**: `show_process_info`
*   **Purpose**: Allows showing or hiding detailed internal processing information of Thoth. If enabled, users can see various steps the system takes to reach the final result. This is an advanced option recommended for advanced users or administrators.

### 2.5 - Show SQL generation

*   **Field Name**: `show_sql_generation`
*   **Purpose**: Controls the visibility of the step-by-step process leading to the generation of the SQL query. If active, users can follow intermediate stages like column and table selection.

### 2.6 - Explain generated query

*   **Field Name**: `explain_generated_query`
*   **Purpose**: If this option is enabled, the system uses an AI model to provide a natural language explanation of the generated SQL query. This is very useful for users who aren't familiar with SQL but want to understand the logic behind the response.

### 2.7 - Treat empty result as an error

*   **Field Name**: `treat_empty_result_as_error`
*   **Purpose**: Determines how the system behaves when a correctly executed SQL query produces no results. If disabled (default setting), an empty result is considered a valid response. If enabled, it's treated as an error, notifying users that their request didn't match any records.

## 3 - Managing Group Profiles

Group profile management is integrated directly into Django's administration interface, making the process simple and centralized.

To modify a `GroupProfile`, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Django's administration panel.
2. In the "Authentication and Authorization" section, click on "Groups".
3. Select the group you want to modify.
4. On the group edit page, you'll find the "Group Profile Settings" section where you can configure all the options described in this document.
5. After making changes, save the form.

The new settings will be applied immediately to all users belonging to that group.
